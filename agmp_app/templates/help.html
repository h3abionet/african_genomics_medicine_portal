            <ol>
                <li><strong>What kind of information can I find in AGMP?</strong></li>

                <p> AGMP contains a compilation of gene and variant information associated with diseases and drugs in
                    the context of African populations. This information was retrieved from existing resources,
                    including PharmGKB and DisGeNET.</p>

                <li><strong>What kind of questions can be answered with AGMP?</strong></li>

                <p> You can answer these type of questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> What are the genes, and variants associated with a particular disease in African populations?
                    </li>
                    <li> What are the genes, and variants associated with a particular drug in African populations?</li>
                    <li> What are the diseases associated with a particular gene in African populations?</li>
                    <li> What are the drugs associated with a particular gene in African populations?</li>
                    <li> What are the diseases associated with a particular variant in African populations?</li>
                    <li> What are the drugs associated with a particular variant in African populations?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <li><strong>What species are covered in AGMP?</strong></li>

                <p> AGMP is focused on human genes and their association with diseases and drugs. More specifically,
                    AGMP focuses only on information related to African populations.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <li><strong>How is AGMP useful?</strong></li>

                <p> The African Genomic Medicine Portal (AGMP) can be used to find relevant gene/variant-disease/drug
                    associations in African populations. This can be used in preliminary/exploratory investigations of
                    African health, or assist in the interpretation of such results. AGMP should NOT be used for
                    clinical decision making purposes.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <li><strong>Why can&rsquo;t I find my searched item in AGMP?</strong></li>

                <p>AGMP provides curated metadata which relates to African populations. These metadata were extracted
                    from
                    PharmGKB and DisGeNET, therefore, if a gene, variant, disease or drug does not appear,
                    there may not be any information related to African populations associated with these in the
                    aforementioned
                    databases. We are currently exploring methods in which to include missing information.
                </p>
                <br />
                <li><strong>Can the portal be used for clinical decision making?</strong></li>
                <p>AGMP should NOT be used for clinical decision-making purposes. However, under the Resources tab,
                    the portal does provide access to resources that may be used for these purposes, such as CPIC.</p>
                <br />
                <li><strong>How do I use the Portal?</strong></li>
                <p>A step-by-step guide for using the Portal can be found in the Tutorial section. This includes
                    expected search inputs and results outputs.</p>
                <br />
                <li><strong>Why are there data missing in some of the result entries?</strong></li>
                <p>Portal metadata are extracted from various types of studies. In some cases, specific metadata fields
                    do not apply or were not found, therefore these fields do not contain information.</p>

                <li><strong>How should I reference AGMP?</strong></li>
                <p>You can cite AGMP as: ------</p>
                <p>Please cite the date on which you accessed the resource.</p>

                <li><strong>A P-value for a variant in AGMP is described as "ambiguous" or left empty. What does this
                        mean?</strong></li>
                <p>This indicates that no such information was identified during data curation.</p>
