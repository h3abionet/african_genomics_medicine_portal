<ol>
    <li><b>How is the Portal useful?</b></li>
    The African Genomics Medicine Portal (AGMP) can be used to find relevant gene/variant-disease/drug associations 
    in African populations. This can be used in preliminary/exploratory investigations of African health, or assist 
    in the interpretation of such results. The portal should <b>NOT</b> be used for clinical decision making purposes. 
    <li><b>Why can't I find my searched gene in the Portal?</b></li>
    The Portal provides curated metadata which relates to African populations. 
    These metadata were extracted from PharmGKB and DisGeNET, therefore, if a gene, variant, 
    disease or drug does not appear, there may not be any information related to African populations 
    associated with these in the aforementioned databases.
    <li><b>Can the portal be used for clinical decision making?</b></li>
    The portal should NOT be used for clinical decision making purposes. However, in the Resources page, 
    the portal does provide resources that may be used for these purposes, such as CPIC.
    <li><b>How do I use the Portal?</b></li>
    A step-by-step guide for using the Portal can be found on the <a href="#">Tutorial</a> page. 
    This includes expected search inputs and results outputs.
