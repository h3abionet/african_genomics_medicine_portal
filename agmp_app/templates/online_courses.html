                <p>This course distills for you expert knowledge and skills mastered by professionals in Health Big Data
                    Science and Bioinformatics. You will learn exciting facts about the human body biology and
                    chemistry,
                    genetics, and medicine that will be intertwined with the science of Big Data and skills to harness
                    the
                    avalanche of data openly available at your fingertips and which we are just starting to make sense
                    of.
                    We’ll investigate the different steps required to master Big Data analytics on real datasets,
                    including
                    Next Generation Sequencing data, in a healthcare and biological context, from preparing data for
                    analysis to completing the analysis, interpreting the results, visualizing them, and sharing the
                    results.</p>

                    learners’
                    current settings and roles. The problem-based practical sessions will emphasize increased knowledge
                    in
                    the genetics of African health issues. In addition, skills in Genetic counselling, Community
                    engagement/Ethical conduct in research and patient care and development of health promotion material
                    will be reinforced. Therefore the course seeks to support improved Genetics & Genomics knowledge.
